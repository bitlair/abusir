Abusir package

Protects the network from rogue Router Advertisements. Allows the NOC to respond to router advertisements, but in the meantime cancel out the settings, so that clients don't end up with bad MTUs, bad DNS search lists, bad recursive DNS or bad prefixes.

- To prevent MTU changes it announces the correct MTU again.
- To prevent bad prefixes it announces the prefix with a valid and preferred lifetime of 0.
- To prevent bad recursive DNS servers, it announces them with valid lifetime of 0.
- To prevent bad DNS search lists, it announces them with valid lifetime of 0.

What's in the name:

Abusir prevents RA Abuse. Abusir is a platform in Egypt with temples for the sun god Ra. Praying to the god Ra at Abusir may work to restore the proper RA settings on the network.
